# üß† Sentiment Analysis on 800K Tweets using NLP and Logistic Regression

This project analyzes 800,000 tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression to predict tweet sentiment as either **positive** or **negative**.

---

## ‚úÖ Project Summary

- Preprocessed raw tweet data
- Applied text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming
- Converted text into vectors using **TF-IDF**
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
- Achieved **77% accuracy**
- Built a simple user interface to predict sentiment from user input

## üîß Tools and Libraries

- `Python`
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `NLTK`, `scikit-learn`
- `TF-IDF Vectorizer`
- `Streamlit` (for UI)

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Removed URLs, mentions, special characters, and stopwords.

2. **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization  
   - Lemmatization  
   - Stemming

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - TF-IDF vectorization of the cleaned tweets

4. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall

5. **Deployment**  
   - Built a basic sentiment prediction UI with Streamlit
